<h1>Assignment &ldquo;code2&rdquo;</h1>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> For this homework you finish implementing an AVLTree
class.  AVLTree extends BST, which is a simple binary search tree
(just a set of keys, not a symbol table).  When you are done, you
submit your AVLTree.java file on Canvas.</p>

<h2>Preparation</h2>

<p>Read both <a href="BST.java">BST.java</a> and <a href="AVLTree.java">AVLTree.java</a>.  You
will not edit BST.java; you only edit AVLTree.java.  The comments in
AVLTree.java describe what you need to do.  In particular, you really
only need to override the <em>fixup</em> method. It should do &ldquo;trinode
restructuring&rdquo; when needed, as described in the
<a href="https://cs.emory.edu/~cs253002/share/0915/AVLTrees.pdf">AVLTrees.pdf</a>
slides.  <em>fixup</em> is already being called where needed in the BST
<em>insert</em> and <em>remove</em> methods, so you do not need to override those.</p>

<p>Note the Node class (defined inside BST.java) does not have a parent link.
Each Node stores just a Key, no value. Each Node has a
size field and a height field.  The size field supports t.get(rank),
t.rank(k), and the iterator.</p>

<p>The BST class also defines a fail-fast iterator (class RankIterator),
but you do not need to modify that.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>There are two testing programs, <a href="Demo.java">Demo.java</a> and
<a href="Tests.java">Tests.java</a>.  Use the Demo program to run small
interactive tests:</p>

<pre><code>  javac *.java
  java Demo
</code></pre>

<p>The above usage expects you to enter some numbers with the keyboard.
You may instead read a prepared input from a file.  We have two files
prepared, <a href="demo1.txt">demo1.txt</a> and <a href="demo2.txt">demo2.txt</a>,
you are welcome to write your own.  You can read input from
a file in either of these two ways:</p>

<pre><code>  java Demo &lt; demo1.txt
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>  java Demo demo2.txt
</code></pre>

<p>The Demo program prints the tree contents in sorted order, with
indentation to indicate the tree structure.</p>

<p>Use the Tests program to run some more extensive non-interactive
tests.  First it does some small test cases, followed by a timing test
(comparing the speed of your AVLTree with java.util.TreeSet, which is
a red-black tree):</p>

<pre><code>  javac *.java
  java Tests
</code></pre>

<p>If your time ratio is at most 2.0, then it is fast enough.</p>

<h2>Submission</h2>

<p>When you are done, or you just want to quit, submit your AVLTree.java
as the Canvas &ldquo;code2&rdquo; assignment.  Check that page for any further
requirements or extra credit.  You may add a &ldquo;comment&rdquo; to your Canvas
submission, if any issues remain.</p>
